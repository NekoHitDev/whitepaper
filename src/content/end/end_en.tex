    "NekoHit" was just a random name that translates into "cat punch".
    The project was born out of a sudden idea from an unknown novel author
    (Wakayume) while walking.
    After talking with a programmer who had just tried blockchain development
    (Sky Blond) at Misskey.
    The project took a very primitive shape after a simple development.

    Then we went to a hackathon organized by the Neo foundation.
    The original purpose was to have a try.
    And during that contest, we met Yannick Koitzsch, a great teammate doing
    the development along with us.
    In the end, it was a great honor that we received the excellence award
    from the Neo Frontier Launchpad.

    I know that we and NekoHit Project are still very young and inexperienced.
    But because we have tried and worked hard, we have been able to grow and
    evolve during the process.
    I would also like to thank everyone who has supported and encouraged us.
    Because of you, we can keep going.

    The excellence award from Neo Frontier Launchpad is just the first step
    we have taken.
    I believe we will go further than we ever thought possible.

    Please looking forward to us.
